LeetChampion is a minimal web app for LeetCode 1v1s and tournaments, designed to be hosted locally.
Features will include live code view for tournaments, game modes, sudden death, and more.

The app is currently in an early PoC phase, with current development focused on building an interactive, LeetCode-like environment using CodeMirror.
This environment is expected to be completed within the coming weeks, and development will move onto researching and integrating LC's GraphQL API.
From there, WebSockets will be added to allow a P2P connection for basic 1v1s.
